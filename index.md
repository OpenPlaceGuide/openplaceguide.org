# Vision

OpenPlaceGuide (formerly known as OpenBusinessMap) will be a free and open source business directory, based on the OpenStreetMap project.
It combines data from the OpenStreetMap project, as well as additional information about businesses and
other places of interest.

An open guide of places.

# OpenPlaceGuide Africa Tile Server

We provide a vector and raster tile server covering all Africa at [https://africa.tiles.openplaceguide.org/](https://africa.tiles.openplaceguide.org/). The tile data is updated minutely.

## Terms of use

* You can use the server for your non-commercial or commercial project under the terms of and with the following copyright notice:
  
  [OPG](https://openplaceguide.org) / [© OpenMapTiles](https://www.openmaptiles.org/) [© OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) 
  
* Do not use it excessively. Excessive use might be throttled. [Contact us](mailto:info@addismap.com?subject=OpenPlaceGuide+Africa+Tiles) if you plan using it for a bigger project.
* Do not use automated tools to mass-download tiles.
* Prefer using vector tiles of raster tiles - they cause much less server load.
